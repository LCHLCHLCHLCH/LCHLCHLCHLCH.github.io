	<h1>A new method to decode and play video on embedded platform</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output
		peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. The common
		type of
		embedded platform is microcontroller, single-board computer, System-on-Chips (Soc) platforms, Field-Programmable
		Gate Array, Embedded Linux Platforms, etc. While A video decoder is a hardware or software that converts encoded
		video stream signals into digital video files including audio, video, captions, subtitles for being playback on
		TV,
		smartphones, tablets, computer monitor, or other streaming devices. A video decoder has the inverse features of
		a
		video encoder, converting uncompressed or raw digital video to analog video. A video decoder can be a hardware
		device such as part of video capture devices, set-top boxes, software, or a plug-in for a computer. The video
		decoder can receive encoded digital video signals, display EPG data, closed caption, and subtitles.</p>
	<p>With the development of technology, multimedia content has been more and more common in our life. At the same
		time,
		embedded device has been increasingly widely used in daily life, from our mobile phone to various electronic
		device’s main control. With the popularization and increase of the need for its function, video decoding and
		playing
		has become indispensable for more and more application. However, due to embedded system’ s weak processing
		ability,
		it’s still a huge challenge to decode and play video stably and efficiently on an embedded platform. The
		considered
		challenges are as followed:</p>
	<p>1. The limited resource and constraint of performance<br>
		The decoding and playing of a video require plenty of resource, which could be easily achieved by modern PC.
		While
		typically, the memory size, CPU frequency, cache, computing ability, etc., are far behind that of modern PC.
		Take a
		modal of STM32 microcontroller for example, its memory size is commonly between 16kb and 256kb, barely enough to
		store a frame of a video.
	</p>
	<p>2. The power consumption and heat dissipation management<br>
		For mobile devices and portable embedded systems, power consumption and heat management are crucial factor.
		Efficient power management are necessary for the aim of extending the lifespan of the battery and the usage
		time.
		Plus, embedded devices are often placed in enclosed space, which is a disadvantage for its heat dissipation.
	</p>
	<p>3. The requirement for real-time and stability<br>
		Certain embedded platform has strict requirement on the real-time and stability of the video decoding and
		playing,
		such as monitoring and medical imaging. On top of this, any delay, crash and stuck could cause serious
		degradation
		of user experience. So searching for a new method to decode and play video on embedded platform is necessary.
	</p>
	<p>4. The support for multi-platform<br>
		Due to the variety and constant update of video format, the decoding method should be flexible and portable
		enough
		to be applied on various platform.
	</p>
	<p>In summary, the decoding and playing of video on embedded platform faces various aspect of challenge and
		requirement,
		so it’s of great meaning to look for a better way to decode video on embedded platform.</p>
	<p>There are several steps for a modern video player to transform a compressed video file to a format which contains
		the
		direct color information of each frame. First, it reads the raw video file into the RAM to start processing it.
		Then
		it tries to traverse the stream info and find the video stream in it. After succeeding in finding it, the
		decoder
		tries to find an appropriate decoder for that video stream and open it. Then it will apply some RAM space to
		store
		the temporary number. If that was finished successfully, it will start the constant process of decoding. First
		it
		reads a “packet” from the stream. If it was a video packet, it will be sent to the decoder. Several video packet
		will generate a video frame which is in the format that can be displayed on the monitor directly, and the
		process
		will go on and on until the video terminates. </p>
	<p>Based on the process mentioned above, the most widely used way to decode video is to run an operating system on
		the
		machine, decode the video using native executable file and display the result using system API. However, if
		several
		new methods raised by me could be applied, the efficiency and performance of playing video on embedded platform
		may
		improve greatly.</p>
